1️⃣ Overview

This document outlines the deployment strategy for an eCommerce application, ensuring security, scalability, and efficiency. The deployment is designed for a cloud-native environment using AWS services and automation tools.

2️⃣ Architecture

Tech Stack:

Cloud Provider: AWS (Amazon Web Services)
Infrastructure as Code (IaC): Terraform
Containerization: Docker
Orchestration: Kubernetes (EKS)
Storage: S3 (static files), RDS (MySQL)
Load Balancer: AWS ALB (Application Load Balancer)

Network & Security:

VPC: Private subnets for databases and application backends
Security Groups & NACLs: Restrict unauthorized access
IAM Roles & Policies: Least privilege access for resources
SSL/TLS Encryption: HTTPS via AWS ACM

3️⃣ Deployment Steps

Step 1: Infrastructure Setup
Provision AWS resources using Terraform:
VPC, Subnets, Route Tables, Security Groups
EKS cluster
RDS for persistent storage
Apply the configuration:

terraform init
terraform apply -auto-approve

Step 2: Application Deployment
Containerize the application:
docker build -t ecommerce-app:latest .
docker push <ECR-Repository-URL>/ecommerce-app:latest

Deploy to Kubernetes
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml

Step 3: CI/CD Pipeline Setup
Jenkins Pipeline for automated deployments
Helm Charts for Kubernetes deployment
Rolling Updates / Blue-Green Deployment for zero downtime

Step 4: Monitoring & Logging
Enable CloudWatch Logs & Prometheus for monitoring
Set up alerts via AWS 

4️⃣ Validation & Testing

Basic Validation Steps:
Verify Application Accessibility:
Access the domain via HTTPS (https://your-ecommerce-domain.com)
Check Load Balancer and DNS resolution
Validate Database Connection:
Connect to RDS using psql or mysql
Check Logs & Metrics:
kubectl logs -f deployment/ecommerce-app
